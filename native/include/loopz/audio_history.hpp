// A fixed logical channel layout, one serial producer and independent readers.
// All storage is allocated at construction. A narrower hardware profile zeros
// absent channels without changing saved wiring. stop() is serialized with the
// producer, after its callbacks have joined; readers may continue concurrently.
// By default, rate/fractional-clock conversion uses a prepared symmetric bandlimited
// kernel, so the caller must queue enough history on both sides of the desired
// timestamp (96 / (0.94 * min(1, outputRate/sourceRate)) source frames). Missing
// support is reported as missing audio; no hidden timestamp shift is applied.
// Equal-rate integer-aligned reads use the direct, zero-lookahead path.
// Past host times use retained callback clock intervals, rather than a newer
// rate estimate. Stable intervals coalesce only within timestamp precision.
// Diagnostic rate estimates use overlapping half-second observations; the
// newest interval can extrapolate until its next callback anchor is available.
// A reader's output clock may also drift within the 0.5% measured-rate bounds.
